# Warfork Scriptutils

This is a collection of angelscript files which might be useful in creating new gametypes for the game Warfork.

These scripts were originally developed for Warsow and are currently being migrated to Warfork. In addition to that, these scripts required a 
modded game library on the gameserver side. Until the relevant changes are merged into upstream Warfork you can build the library using 
[this project](https://github.com/ja-ko/warfork-qfusion/tree/gt-modifications) (gt-modifications branch).

Also these scripts heavily depended on the Warsow authentication to implement statistics, awards and other features. Until Warfork provides a
similar authentication model, for example by integrating with Steam, this functionality will not work.

This Readme is supposed to be gradually enhanced once the included scripts are actually useable and useful.
